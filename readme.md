# **End-to-End DevOps Automation: Terraform & CI/CD for a Spring Boot Application**


## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to design, provision, and automate a multi-environment AWS infrastructure (Dev, Staging, Production) using Terraform, and deploy a Spring Boot application through a CI/CD pipeline with a custom domain and HTTPS.

The goal is to simulate a real world, production-ready DevOps workflow without using Kubernetes, focusing instead on core DevOps fundamentals.


### **Architecture Overview**

**Key Components:**

- AWS VPC (per environment)

- Public Subnets
